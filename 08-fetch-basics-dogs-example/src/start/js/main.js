Fetch Fundamentals
In this example, we're going to fetch and display random pictures of dogs
1. Select the random dog button and add a click event listener on it
2. Create a function to get a random dog image using the fetch api
    - documentation for the dog api here https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
    - explore and display what the promise returns
3. Create a function that will set the image in the document to the one
    retrieved from the dog API
4. Call the random dog function in your click event listener,
    and also call it when the page loads (so a dog appears right away)
